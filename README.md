This is a collabrative project made by me and my friend so it is being forked from the parent repo

Welcome to the repository for the MeritMess - Project Management Real-Time Website. This application provides an efficient platform to manage projects, connect with mentors, track achievements, and monitor your project progress, all in real time.

MeritMess is a collaborative platform designed for young individuals (13-25 years) to turn 
their ideas into reality through project management, team collaboration, and 
mentorship. Think of it as a beginner-friendly GitHub meets Trello, with built-in 
mentorship. 

Why ProGrow? 

• Students struggle to move from ideas to actual projects 

• Hard to find team members with similar interests 

• Limited access to experienced mentors 

• Existing platforms are too complex for beginners 

• Need for practical project experience
